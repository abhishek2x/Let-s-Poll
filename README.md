# Let-s-Poll

Design and develop a website application where:
1. Logged in users can create polls that can be public or private
2. Public polls can be voted by non-logged in users
3. Private polls need login for voting
4. Each new poll will expire after 5 minutes (Voting will only be open for 5 minutes, after which it will considered inactive)
5. Both Public and private polls can be seen on the homepage (both active and inactive)
6. Each poll displayed will have the following information - Time left before it is inactive, created by, created at(time it was created at)

Design of a poll:

A poll has a question and any number of options. The poll can be marked as public or private. Voting on any option will display the results of the active poll. For inactive poll (5 minutes expired since posting) display only the results

User Design:
Logged in user can create new poll and look at his past created polls from his profile
Logged in user can also delete polls which have not expired
Logged out user can only vote

You may use any framework of your choice. You are free to add more features of your choice( add tags, configure time to expire, search polls, etc). Preference will also be given to a better user interface. Please deploy your code on any free hosting service and share the link of the site.
